Cleans the Beijing Multi-Site Air Quality Dataset (Aotizhongxin station) using R.

What it does
Imports and inspects the dataset with error handling (tryCatch)
Differentiates NA, NULL, and NaN
Summarizes missing values per variable
Imputes numeric variables using median (loop-based, reusable code)
Imputes categorical variable (wind direction) using mode
Validates a derived pollution_ratio variable for NA/NaN/Inf
Compares missing values before vs after cleaning
Visualizes missingness with a bar chart
Exports the cleaned dataset as CSV
